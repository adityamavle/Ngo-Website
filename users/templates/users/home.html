              • A non-governmental organization (NGO) is an organization that is
              neither a part of a government nor a conventional for-profit
              business. • NGOs may be funded by governments, foundations,
              schools, businesses or private people. • Some may have charitable
              status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on
              recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for
              political, religious, or other interests.

              >• The term "non-governmental organization" was first coined in
              1945, when the United Nations (UN) was created and there were 1083
              NGOs. • According to the UN any kind of private organization that
              is independent from government control can be termed as ‘NGO’. •
              In some countries the term NGO is applied to an organization that
              in another country would be called as NPO (non profit
              organization). • International NGOs were important in the
              anti-slavery movement and the movement for women's suffrage. •
              Based on Societies Registration Act (SRA) NGO was approved in
              1860. • India is estimated to had around 2 million NGOs in 2014.
